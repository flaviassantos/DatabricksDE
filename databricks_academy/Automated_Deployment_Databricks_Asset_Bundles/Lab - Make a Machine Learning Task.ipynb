    "\n",
    "    - We will need to point these to our bundle YAML files.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - Option 4: Find your cluster ID by navigating to Compute on the left menu, clicking on your cluster, selecting the three vertical dots, and clicking **View JSON**. Copy the cluster ID near the top of the JSON. Alternatively, you can get the cluster ID by running the following code snippet in a new cell: `print(spark.conf.get(\"spark.databricks.clusterUsageTags.clusterId\"))`.

By understanding how the YAML files are structured, you were able to update your workflow by defining new variables and create a new task - one that you didn't even necessarily need to know about.\n",
