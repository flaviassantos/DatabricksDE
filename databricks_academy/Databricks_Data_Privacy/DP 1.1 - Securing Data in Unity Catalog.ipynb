    "* This privilege will also be extended to any future tables/views, as well as any future schemas that appear within the catalog\n",
    "\n",
    "While this can be very convenient for granting access to hundreds or thousands of tables, we must be very careful how we set this up when using privilege inheritance because it's much easier to grant permissions to the wrong things accidentally. Also keep in mind the above approach is extreme. A slightly less permissive compromise can be made, while still leveraging privilege inheritance, with the following two grants. Note, you don't need to run these statements; they're merely provided as an example to illustrate the different types of privilege structures you can create that take advantage of inheritance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dynamic views provide the ability to do fine-grained access control of columns and rows within a table, conditional on the principal running the query. Dynamic views are an extension to standard views that allow us to do things like:\n",
    "* partially obscure column values or redact them entirely\n",
    "* omit rows based on specific criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Access control with dynamic views is achieved through the use of functions within the definition of the view. These functions include:\n",
    "* `current_user()`: returns the email address of the user querying the view\n",
    "* `is_account_group_member()`: returns TRUE if the user querying the view is a member of the specified group\n",
    "* `is_member()`: returns TRUE if the user querying the view is a member of the specified workspace-local group\n",
